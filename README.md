#  Library Management System (MySQL)

##  Project Overview
The **Library Management System (LMS)** is a DBMS project implemented in **MySQL** to efficiently manage the operations of a library.  
It covers functionalities such as maintaining book records, member details, issuing and returning of books, dues calculation, and reporting.  

The project uses **tables, triggers, stored procedures, and functions** to simulate a real-world library workflow.  
It also includes **error handling, audit trail via history table, and business rules enforcement**.

---

##  Purpose of the Project
- To automate and simplify library operations.  
- To track book availability, issued/returned books, and overdue fines.  
- To maintain member details, their borrowing history, and dues.  
- To provide **reports** on books, members, and publishers.  
- To enforce **business rules** (borrowing limits, dues, Sunday restriction).

## Final Notes
This project demonstrates a realistic library workflow using SQL features like triggers, functions, procedures, and constraints.
It can be extended into a full-stack Library Management application by integrating with Java, Python, or a Web Framework.
